# Introduction #

The boss said I had to move my Mediawiki into Sharepoint. That's easier said than done. Here I'm posting my work so someone else can use it and perhaps improve it.  It's very basic but our wiki wasn't that big.

If you combine this code or logic with that [here](http://sites.google.com/site/sharepointwikiuploader/Home) then we might have something really useful.

I'm leaving my work here and then I'm done. If anyone wants to commit changes please let me know - I'll be glad to grant commit access.
